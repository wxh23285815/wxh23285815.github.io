Mālama I Nā Ahupuaʻa (MINA) is a service learning that I participated in BOT 105, at Spring 2106. The service learning project helped me learn and understand the traditional cultures, practices, and beliefs of Hawaiian people and lands.

Mālama I Nā Ahupuaʻa is a first-hand experience for young people to see and learn how the Ahupuaʻa system, in which the Mālama I Nā Ahupuaʻa are trying to revival and maintain the Hawaiian practices to sustain the land.
