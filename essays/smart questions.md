## Questions
  At the time of learning, questions are the best communication tool between an educator and students. However, educator often views the question that students ask is good or bad. In university, a good or bad question has a different effect on the student's education and learning.  When working on an assignment or learning new subjects, sometimes I get stuck at some material, and not sure what and how to ask for an answer.

  According to Eric Raymond, there is a process to ask questions in a good/smart way. At first, identify the thing you want to know or understand, and then before asking someone, find the answer on your own or professor. When asking the question, it must be direct and understandable and make sure the professor understand what you try to ask. [](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
