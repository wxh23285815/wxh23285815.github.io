Most people think that software engineering simply just some codes or commands for working a program or machine. However, it is more than that. When learning and understanding software engineering, one must able to access and understand the open-source software, create functional programming, have friendly user interface frameworks in the program, and have an ethical viewpoint in software engineering. 
 
#### ICS 314

ICS 314 software engineering, a course provided for computer engineers, software engineers, and computer science students. To any student has taken the course, they referred the course as an experience of learning web development. Simply put, it is not a hundred percent wrong, and there is more to the course then just developing websites. In ICS 314, one learns the basic of web program language (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI, React, etc.) and apply to practices, assignments, and projects. With it trains the students to be more efficient, perfect, and fast on they performed in coding function and program. Anyone is able to experience real-life software engineering experience through the ICS 314, and have feel of work as a software engineer.

#### Software Engineering Community

In Hawaii, the community of software engineering is very small and have little interaction, but software engineers are trying to improve the interaction and evolution of technology. As a future software engineer, one tries can be engaged in events and activities of the local plan and development for software and technology. We can apply the knowledge and skill to help improve our community, even we aren't able to help we still can learn about some new in our software engineering community.
