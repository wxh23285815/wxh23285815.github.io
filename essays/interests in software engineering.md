## Interests
When I started college, I was unclear about my path of the future, and have no ideas of what to focus and major. During that time, I mostly interested in is online games and puzzle. Often, I will download online games on my computer and play it. However, unlike others, I do not simply play the game and have fun.  I try to analysis the game's operator, graphics, control, strategy, gameplay and more. After I finish analyzing a game, I uninstall and delete it and move on to another game. In college, the closest thing that similar to my interest is in software engineering, for example, analyzing the code, solving the problems, compiling function. Lasted about, which make me decide to major in computer science.

## Path
My path in computer science is just started. Farther on, I still have many program function and code to learn. I hope I able to learn and understand all the program language and provided in actions creating coding files with outstanding programs. Also to improve my skill as a programmer in C++, Unity, and Command, be to faster and effectively at coding and operating the system.  

After graduating as computer science, I hope I able to apply my skill as computer science in the work field and interesting job. For any opportunity may come, I want to personally create an authentic game of my own using what I learn in computer science.
