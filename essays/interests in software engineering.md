## Interests
When I started college, I was unclear about my path of the future, and have no ideas of what to focus and major. During that time, I mostly interested in is online games and puzzle. Often, I will download online games on my computer and play it. However, unlike others, I do not simply play the game and have fun.  I try to analysis the game's operator, graphics, control, strategy, gameplay and more. After I finish analyzing a game, I uninstall and delete it and move on to another game. In college, the closest thing that similar to my interest is in software engineering, for example, analyzing the code, solving the problems, compiling function. Lasted about, which make me decide to major in computer science.
